HOW TO USE SOLEMN 2D

This app uses a simple way to make animations, 
(by looping through images) to create a video,
 so to use the app you'll have to make each frame
 by yourself, you can design them in apps like 
mspaint, coreldraw, photoshop e.t.c, and import
 the images in the file, by pressing the open 
image button in the file menu, or drag and drop
the image to the window, and continue the
 opening of images on each frame, the drawing
tools in solemn 2d are not that good and are not
adviced for whole drawings, but they would get better
in future versions. you can also 
delete the frame with the delete frame button in
then import the sound of the animation with the 
import button the tool menu as well, there are a
 set of tools for editing sounds to add special
effects at your left.set the frames per second 
(fps), then click the preview button to see your
 animation, you can save the file with Ctrl+S or
 click the save button in the file menu, and open
 it for later, make sure you don't delete the images
 you're using for your animations keep them safely in
 a folder.You can preview the animation during the 
process and export it with the export button when 
you are done with the project you are working on.
